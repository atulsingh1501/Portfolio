## üöÄ About The Project

This project is my personal space on the web. It's a single-page application designed to be a comprehensive showcase of my journey as a developer and designer. I've focused on creating a modern, visually appealing, and interactive experience using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced with libraries for animations and particle effects.
